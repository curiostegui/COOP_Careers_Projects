## Data Analysis and Visualization Project Details

With your pod group, you’ll create a brief and comprehensive presentation showcasing your observations, insights, and recommendations from a data set provided to you, or one of your choosing for a **mock client**. 

**Each pod member** should contribute to the introduction and conclusion and is responsible for creating at least one slide showing a data visualization **AND** an observation or insight.

Pods will present the presentation in front of the class, captains, and members of HQ. There’s no slide limit, but the presentation should be < 15 minutes.

Each Pod within each Cohort must choose a dataset that is unique from other Pods within the same Cohort. You may select your own dataset outside of the four preselected datasets if the dataset is over 500 rows of data and approved by your pod captain or program manager. 

### Dataset Guidelines

- Datasets must be over 500 rows 
  - *Note:* adding different data sets together doesn’t count
- Project should be **fairly original**; the more common/general the problem, the harder it will be to make original insights 
  - *E.g.*, topics like voter turnout, political patterns, COVID, etc. are all commonly studied topics (by big-time data scientists), so it will be difficult to a) not be influenced by their conclusions, and b) interpret the data through an original lens and come up with novel recommendations
- Data should be as **specific** as possible
  - *E.g.*, if you’re looking at high school graduation rates, look at the county level instead of the national level
- **Bonus challenge:** Scrape your own data! (If you have the know-how!)

## NBA Tempo & Injuries: Analyzing the Effects on Performance and Winnings

## Introduction

In about the last 10 years, we have witnessed a faster tempo and perimeter based game in the NBA. With the success of Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors has come the rise of high volume three point shooting, a more dynamic team playstyle, as well as versatile and non-traditional lineups which sacrifices size for speed. Player contracts have also grown over the years as the NBA continues to expand its market. As a result of this economic growth, player injuries have become more costly: they can remove teams on the verge of winning from championship contention and tie up salary cap commitments to players who aren’t active. Loss of star players can lead to a decrease in viewership and following of the team overall. Fatigue and injury management has been a growing issue in the League. In this project we will examine if there is a relationship between the higher tempo style of today’s game and injuries as well as how both variables impact championship performance.

## Goal

The goal of our project is to examine pace and possession trends in the League, explore the amount of player injuries and cash earned while inactive, and ultimately, analyze the relationships between these variables and their effects on championship outcomes.  

## Data Sets

The data will be pulled from the following sites:

- [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/)
- [spotrac.com](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/)
